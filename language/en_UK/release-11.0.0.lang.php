A version 2.10 or 2.11 does not reflect the huge work we\'ve put into the redesign of Piwigo user interface, even if the technical backend did not change much. We want to make obvious we\'re bringing a lot of improvements with these versions. Maybe version 2.10 should have been a version 3, as some of the community members suggested.
