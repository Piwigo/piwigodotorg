<p>This release is a bug fixes release, no new feature. Since database model does not change, upgrading simply means to copy modified files. Template “default” not modified so templates compatible with 1.4.0 are still compatible with 1.4.1. No modification in language items (so languages compatible with 1.4.0 are still compatible with 1.4.1).</p>
